# LiterateAstroids

# Overview
 
 Are you smarter than an astroid? These astroids all know their favorite words and will challenge you to see if you know them. Can you survive this assault of letters?
 
 This game is designed to help students learn to type better by making it fun. We have integrated the process of learning to type with a game of astroids. 

Once a player types the correct letter displayed in the astroid, the ship will shoot a laser at the astroid to destroy it.
